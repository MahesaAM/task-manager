# Real-Time Socket.IO Integration Plan

## Backend (Laravel)

- [x] Install and configure laravel-echo-server for Socket.IO broadcasting
- [x] Update config/broadcasting.php to use 'redis' driver for echo-server compatibility
- [x] Ensure JWT authentication works with broadcasting channels
- [x] Verify TaskCreated, TaskUpdated, TaskDeleted events are properly broadcasting
- [x] Update laravel-echo-server.json configuration for Socket.IO on port 6001

## Frontend (Vue 3 + Vite)

- [x] Remove laravel-echo and pusher-js dependencies
- [x] Install socket.io-client
- [x] Update main.ts to use socket.io-client instead of Laravel Echo
- [x] Configure Socket.IO connection with JWT authentication
- [x] Update tasks.ts store to listen for real-time events and update state
- [x] Test real-time updates across multiple clients

## Testing

- [ ] Test Socket.IO server startup
- [ ] Test broadcasting events from backend
- [ ] Test frontend receiving events and updating UI
- [ ] Test JWT authentication for Socket.IO connections
